			<h3>Here is the time line of Gandhi's Life</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Civil rights activist in South Africa (1893–1914).</strong> He spent 21 years in South Africa, where he developed his political views, ethics and political leadership skills.</li>
				<li><strong>Struggle for Indian Independence (1915–47).</strong> At the request of Gokhale, conveyed to him by C.F. Andrews, Gandhi returned to India in 1915. He brought an international reputation as a leading Indian nationalist, theorist and organiser.</li>
				<li><strong>Role in World War I.</strong> n April 1918, during the latter part of World War I, the Viceroy invited Gandhi to a War Conference in Delhi.[73] Perhaps to show his support for the Empire and help his case for India's independence.</li>
				<li><strong>Champaran and Kheda.</strong>Gandhi's first major achievements came in 1918 with the Champaran and Kheda agitations of Bihar and Gujarat. </li>
				<li><strong>Khilafat movement</strong>.Gandhi's first major achievements came in 1918 with the Champaran and Kheda agitations of Bihar and Gujarat. The Champaran agitation pitted the local peasantry against their largely British landlords who were backed by the local administration. </li>
				<li><strong>Non-cooperation.</strong>In 1919, Gandhi, with his weak position in Congress, decided to broaden his political base by increasing his appeal to Muslims. </li>
				<li><strong>Salt Satyagraha (Salt March).</strong>Gandhi stayed out of active politics and, as such, the limelight for most of the 1920s. He focused instead on resolving the wedge between the Swaraj Party and the Indian National Congress, and expanding initiatives against untouchability, alcoholism, ignorance, and poverty. </li>
					
			</ul>
